-> Navigate to the Front Directory:
Begin by navigating to the Front directory of the project. This directory contains the necessary Python files to run the application.

-> Open and Run 'main.py':
Locate the file named main.py within the Front directory.
Open this file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Python.

Navigate to the BackDev directory and find the BDD file containing the SQL code.
Copy the SQL code from this file.

Open your MAMP application (or any other SQL database management tool).
Paste the copied SQL code into the SQL query section of your database management tool and execute the query. This will set up the necessary database structure for the application.

You may need to create user accounts to fully utilize the application. To do this, use the account creation feature within the application.

To create an employee account, use the special 'code' field that appears during the account creation process. Enter the code '12' in this field to designate the account as an employee account.
